Description : The program can be used to store data in any type of file to a .bmp image file. A string can be input by the user
	      which ensures that, without which the encoded data cannot be decrypted.  
Language : C  
Compiler used : GCC (Compile as : gcc *.c )  
  
Usage (To be given via command line)  
To encode : ./a.out -e bmpfile.bmp secret_file.extension output_file.bmp*  
To decode : ./a.out -d encoded_image.bmp output_file_name**  
  
NOTE: * The output file name is optional. In case of no input, default filename will be created by the program.  
       ** The output file name only need to be passed if needed. The extension will be automatically added by the  
        program based on data decoded from the image.
